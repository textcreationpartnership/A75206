            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>SInce the taking of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> by a Detachment of our Army, the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> has employed all his skill to Repoſſeſs himſelf of that place, by reaſon of its Advantagious Situation, but hitherto he has been fruſtrated in all his Deſigns. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the 9th and 10th he broke up, with his Camp, in hopes to ſurprize the <hi>Count van der Lippe,</hi> who had put a ſtrong Garriſon into that place: But his Majeſty having timely Notice of his Deſign; gave immediately Orders to our Army to March, which we did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the 10th in the Afternoon, and about 5 a Clock at Night, we came within Sight of the Enemy, we Marched directly towards him; And about Night our whole Army was ranged in order of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, within a Cannon Shot of the <hi>French.</hi> They had poſted themſelves upon the Hills of <hi>Faubrechies,</hi> and we had <hi>Beaumont</hi> in the midſt of our Line. The whole Night was ſpent in laying Bridges over a Water and Moraſs that was between us and the Enemy, ſome of our Cannons were Planted, and we intended to paſs the Bridges by break of Day, and to Attack the Enemy, but his Majeſty being advanced within a Muſquet Shot of the Enemy, and taken a full view of the Ground, it was found that there was not Room enough to Range four Regiments in order of Battle; There being nothing but Defilees on all ſides, and that Conſequently it was impoſſible to Attack the Enemy, without hazarding our whole Camp. We remain'd nevertheleſs in order of Battle, to try if the Enemy would give himſelf the Trouble to come half way; But they keeping themſelves very cloſe according to their uſual manner, we returned in the ſight of the Enemy. It was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they would fall into our Reer: Having ſo fair an opportunity for it; But not a Man of theirs ſtirr'd, and we arrived ſafely into our old Camp at Court. Since this time orders have been ſent to the Bailiffs and Majors to have eigtheen thouſand Pioneers ready to March, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three days time, and this is without doubt to execute ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Enterpriſe. We have indeed not been able as yet to provoke
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150543:2"/>our Enemy to a Pitch-Battel, nor have we taken any great Fortreſſes; But if underſtanding Men will ſoberly conſider that his Majeſty has forc'd the <hi>French,</hi> to entertain for ſo Conſiderable a time, Two vaſt Armys within their own Territories, that ſo conſiderable a part of the <hi>French</hi> Kings Dominions, that enabled his Forces to make ſuch great Excurſions into the remaining <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Provinces, are now deſtroyed and laid waſt, And that in the mean time, there is time given to the Subjects of his Catholick Majeſty quietly to bring in their Harveſt, and conſequently to fill the Magazins with Proviſions for the next Campaign, I ſay they that conſider all this, will certainly agree that the King has done very much, and more than reaſonably could be expected, altho' it ſhould not come to any conſiderable Action this year, which as yet we have great reaſon to hope, for the laſt News we had out of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Piedmont</hi> entertain us in our hopes of great Succeſs on that ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montmelian</hi> makes a vigorous defence, though it has been formally Beſieged, and the Trenches opened eight days ago. <hi>Catinat</hi> with the main Body retreats towards <hi>Pignerol,</hi> and Prince <hi>Eugene</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at his heels. Upon their Retreat to <hi>Piobes,</hi> Prince <hi>Eugene</hi> fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Rear with 500 Horſe, and cut entirely off three Squadrons of Horſe, and a Troop of Carbines of the Enemy, but the Enemy, being reinforced, the Prince did retreat, and had certainly loſt his life, in caſe a <hi>German</hi> had not killed a <hi>French</hi> Dragoon that was juſt going to ſhoot the Prince. In the mean time, the <hi>French</hi> carry all their proviſions out of that Country into <hi>Dauphine,</hi> which is a certain ſign that they have but little hopes to maintain themſelves in <hi>Savoy.</hi> The three <hi>German</hi> Generals <hi>Caraffa, Palfi,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Commercy,</hi> are alrerdy arrived at <hi>Turin,</hi> and his Electoral Highneſs of <hi>Bavaria</hi> is expected there himſelf within few days, he having taken the Poſt at <hi>Munichen, Auguſt</hi> the 10th. <hi>New-ſtile,</hi> Beſides the <hi>German</hi> Succors has all paſt through the Dutchy of <hi>Milain</hi> from whence we have received this following Liſt,
